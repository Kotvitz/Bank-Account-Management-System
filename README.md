# Bank Account Management System

This is a Java application designed for the bank accounts management. You can perform simple operations such as creating an account with a holder, payment, withdrawal or data modification. All necessary data is saved in the database and retrieved from it. I used SQLite for database management, but I encourage to experiment with another systems ;)
